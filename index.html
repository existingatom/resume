    <section class="interest">
        I've got many interests but primarily I love writing. Writing ranging from poems to proses to short stories,
        everything makes its way to my notes apps. So basically I am an unpaid writer at your service. Talking about
        my
        technical side, I have been very actively learning DSA and OOPs using cpp. Moreover, I am also trying my
        hands
        on web development and I have already learnt a lot about HTML and CSS.

    <section class="projects">
        I've authored many books till now and have also been active as content writers in many clubs and societies
        in
        and outside college. Moreover, I have won many prizes for various literary events like that of public
        speaking,
        writing and even singing. Added to that, now I am trying to do various other projects related to webdev and
        I
        believe I will become better in it soon.
